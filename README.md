# PointercrateDarkmode

This is a script written with TypeScript which provides a DarkMode for the Pointercrate API Website.

At the moment, you can only use this by copying the code written in the darkmode.js file and pasting it into an extension such as Tampermonkey and others.

This is my first time so gimme feedback <3
