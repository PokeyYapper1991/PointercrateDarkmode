# PointercrateDarkmode

This is a script written with TypeScript which provides a DarkMode for the Pointercrate API Website.

At the moment, you can only use this by copying the code written in the [darkmode.js](scripts/darkmode.js) file and pasting it into an extension such as Tampermonkey and others.

This is my first time so gimme feedback <3
